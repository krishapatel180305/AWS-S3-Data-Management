This project demonstrates my skills in cloud storage and data management using AWS S3. It includes scripts for creating a bucket, managing file uploads, and securing access with IAM policies.

## Project Description
My goal was to create and manage an S3 bucket to store and organize data. This involved understanding key S3 concepts and access management.

## Technologies Used
* **AWS:** The primary cloud service provider.
* **Amazon S3:** Used for creating and managing scalable object storage.
* **AWS IAM:** Used to secure the S3 bucket by managing user permissions and access policies.

## Key Learnings
This project helped me gain a practical understanding of S3 buckets, object storage, and implementing security best practices using IAM.
